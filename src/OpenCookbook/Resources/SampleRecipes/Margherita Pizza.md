## Make the Dough

Dissolve yeast in warm water with sugar. Let stand for 5 minutes until foamy.

In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in center and add yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until dough comes together.

Knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.

## Assemble and Bake

Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat.

Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, stretch or roll each piece into a 12-inch circle.

Spread tomato sauce evenly over dough, leaving a ½-inch border. Distribute mozzarella slices on top.

Bake for 12-15 minutes until crust is golden and cheese is bubbling.

Remove from oven and immediately top with fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and pepper. Slice and serve hot.
