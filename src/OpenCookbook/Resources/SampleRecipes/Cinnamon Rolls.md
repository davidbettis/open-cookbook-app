Warm the milk to about 110°F. Stir in yeast and a pinch of sugar. Let stand for 5-10 minutes until foamy.

In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with sugar, melted butter, and egg. Add flour and salt, mixing until a soft dough forms.

Knead on a floured surface for 5-8 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour until doubled.

While the dough rises, prepare the filling by mixing softened butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon until well combined.

Punch down the dough and roll out on a floured surface into a 16x12 inch rectangle. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border along one long edge.

Starting from the long edge opposite the border, roll the dough tightly into a log. Cut into 12 equal pieces using a sharp knife or dental floss.

Place rolls in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan, leaving a little space between each. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake for 22-28 minutes until golden brown.

While the rolls bake, make the frosting by beating cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla, and beat until fluffy.

Spread frosting over warm rolls and serve immediately.
