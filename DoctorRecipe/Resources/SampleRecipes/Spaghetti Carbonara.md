Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

While pasta cooks, cook pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 8-10 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat.

In a bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano, and black pepper.

Add hot drained pasta to the skillet with pancetta. Remove pan from heat.

Quickly pour egg mixture over pasta, tossing constantly to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time if needed to reach desired consistency.

Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately with extra cheese on top.
